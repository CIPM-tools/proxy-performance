# EMF Proxy Performance Tests

The Eclipse Modeling Framework provides means to create metamodels and models. For performance optimizations, it includes a proxy mechansim, with which references between models are lazy loaded. This repository provides the source code and resulting data for experiments, assessing the performance of the proxy mechanism. Every experiment is related to a specific factor of the proxy resolution.
